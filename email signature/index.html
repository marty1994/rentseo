            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>In order to get things rolling we need a few details from you. Ideally if you could send us the information in the order below that would be great! </p>
            <ol style="padding-left: 20px; padding-top: 20px">
                <li style="padding-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.3em;">Go to google and search for your <u>competitors</u> - Jot down all the websites you like the look of in a word editor like notepad, or microsoft word. Find a minimum of three websites. </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.3em;">If you have any logos, images or general graphics you would like to be placed into your website please send to us.</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.3em;">Theme colors. As you probably know there are hundreads of thounsands of different shaded colors you can choose from. To make life easier for us please use <a href="http://www.color-hex.com/color-names.html" target="_blank">this website</a> to choose your colors and list the hexadecimal color code's <span style="color:#d2691e">(#d2691e)</span> for us  </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.3em;">With our standard website rental service you get 4 pages. Usually these are Home page, About us page, Contact us page, and services page. These of course can be different pages. In your word editor please list the titles of the pages you would like - if nothing is listed we will assume the pages above are the pages you would like. </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.3em;">Now you have listed your pages this will give you clear define subjects you can write about. Under each page title you have listed in step 2, please write as much straight to the point information. <b>Remember: Write the way you would want to read when you are browsing for a service.</b> If you feel you are struggling with this, we do offer a <a href="http://rentseo.co.uk/shop/product/content-creation-services/" target="_blank">content creation service</a>. </li>
                <li>The final step is to attach all of these steps into an email and send to your account manager. <b>Note: Steps 1, 3, and 4 are needed to bein the project. Step 5 can be sent at a later date. We will use demo date to fill in the gaps.</b></li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Next, Next Steps</h2>
            <p>Once we have the above information its now up to us to build a great looking website for your business that you love and your target audience will love.</p>
            <p>Here is what to expect for the next, next steps. </p>
            <ol style="padding-left: 20px; padding-top: 20px">
                <li style="padding-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.3em;">We create a design concept. This will not be a functional website - the purpose of this mockup design is to show you what your website will look like. Once you have approved the design we will start building. Please make sure you are 100% positive about the design before you approve as once we start the development process any additional structural changes to the layout of the design will be charged for.</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.3em;">Once you have approved step one we will move onto the development stage. This is where we bring the design to life. This will be built on a demo domain name where only the people with the link will be able to view it. </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.3em;">Once the website has been built and approved we then move the site onto your official domain name <b>(Please see next section for information about this and what we might need from you.)</b></li>
            </ol>
        </div>

            <h2>Important Domain Information</h2>
            <p>If you already have a domain you would like to use we will need the following information:</p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 20px; padding-top: 20px;">
                <li style="padding-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Username and password</b> for your domain hosting account (godaddy, pickaweb, 1and1 etc...)</li>

            </ul>
            <p>If you do not own a domain name you can use <a href="https://namechk.com/" target="_blank">this website</a> to find a domain name which is not already been purchased. Once you have found one, let us know and we will purchase it for you. If for what ever reason you would like to leave us, we will sell the domain name to you for the same price we bought it for. </p>
